<h2 id="notes-to-user"> Notes to the User (important) </h2>
<h3 id="updating-parameters"> Updating Parameters </h3>
<p>If you want to use this tool for dimensioning and planning purposes, asses the parameters and input thoroughly. The parameters in the <b>cycles_to_failure</b> function and in the <b>classes and properties</b> section (especially the economic parameters) should be investigated and updated, if not, results will be loose practical value. If your parameters are very precise/predictable, you may utilize the fine tuning aspects of this tool. One example of fine tuning is the step of LCoE (levelized cost of energy) and NPC (net present cost) whenever another battery replacement is necessary (look for the steps in the simulation overview surface plot). If not, please only use the trends from the simulation to plan your power plant installation. For a brief summary of small scale electricity generation, read up <a href="http://www.mpoweruk.com/ss_electricity_generation.htm"> here</a></p>
<h3 id="ipv-jbatt">iPv and jBatt</h3>
<p> These variables are recurring in the implementation as a way of choosing solutions. When iterating through the different combinations of PV and battery sizes, the for-loops will use iPv and jBatt as the iteration variables. ex. for iPv = pvStartKw:pvStepKw:pvStopKw. These iteration names are also used later in the code to refer to the same PV and battery combination. ex the largest size of PV and battery have the loss of load of SimulationOutputs.lossOfLoad(:,iPv,jBatt) = SimulationOutputs.lossOfLoad(:, nPv, nBatt) where nPv and nBatt is the number of iterations of each component size. </p>
<h3 id="data-location">Data Location</h3>
The datasets needs to be located under the database folder under a folder that defines the set. This is input to the dst_platform under filenames (just the names) and dataset (the folder which the files are located inside the database folder)

<h2 id="gui"> GUIs </h2>
<p> Here follows explanation of the different user interfaces that run the DST and how to use them. (How the GUIs are implemented will be explained at the bottom of the document.) </p> 

<h3 id="dst-gui"> dst_gui </h3>
<p>The DST GUI is a tool for changing the parameters/ saving presets and for running the different modules with these settings. It allows for presets to be saved and deleted, this means that the drop down menu will change the parameters to the value saved, even the check boxes. It is not necessary to save a preset to run it. You can run all the modules with the "run all modules button", or run single modules by pressing their respective run buttons, note that the necessary variables from the preceding modules need to be in place if you want correct results.</p>
<p> The GUI programs will assign the appropriate values to the workspace, when a "run module" button is pressed. </p>
<p>&nbsp</p> 
<img src="dst_gui.png">
<p><font size="2"> <a href="#top"> (back to top) </a> </font></p>

<h3 id="solution-explorer"> solution_explorer </h3>
<p>The solution explorer allows for key data from a given solution to be displayed. The top list displays the different solutions that was found. They are identified by a solution number, a net present cost, a levelized cost of energy and a loss of load probability</p>
<p> There are three display options, two windows in the tool, and one option will make a new window. The choices for output are <b>general info</b> will give you an overview of the simulation, <b>averages</b> and <b> worst case </b>will allow for an understanding of the system performance and the <b>biomass system</b> will inform about how the biomass system functioned.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="sapv-plant-simulation"> [ simOutput ] = sapv_plant_simulation( SimulationParameters, PvParameters, BatteryParameters, InverterParameters, SimulationInputData ) </h3>
<p> This is the "Stand Alone PV Plant Simulation". It simulates the entire time series of the input data for every combination of PV and battery value, chosen as the simulation parameters. The module output is the class SimulationOutputs. Computational complexity O(n^3) (nHours*nPvSteps*nBattSteps) </p>
<p>The system works roughly as follows: The load is covered by the irradiation input from the PV array, pvPowerAbsorbedKw, if there is more power left, it goes to the battery, when there is insufficient, the battery will cover the load (if it has enough charge). For each cycle, after at least 8 hours of discharging, the algorithm detects the depth of discharge and calculate the partial wear on the battery (more on this in the simulation outputs, and partial cycles), what is important to note is that this wear on the battery is the basically the only result used for the economic analysis.</p>
<h3 id="pvbiomass-plant-simulation"> [ simOutput ] = pvbiomass_plant_simulation( SimulationParameters, PvParameters, BatteryParameters, InverterParameters, SimulationInputData, BiomassParameters ) </h3>
<p> An adaption of pv_plant_simulation to include the utilization of a biomass generator parallel to the system. Since there is a wide variation of biomass generators available, the implementation is as generic as possible so that each systems functionality can be implicitly included whether it is automatic or governed by human response. The input unit is in kW, this leaves the conversion to the user, all assumptions about mass to energy conversion is hence excluded from the implementation. The reason for this is the large differences between biomass power productions. Read more about <div id="biomass-reference"> TODO: put biomass reference here </div></p> 
<p>The system will always be in one of the following states: </p>
<blockquote>
	<h4>Idle</h4>
	<p>The system is turned off and ready. Transition to the <b>starting up</b> state if there is a loss of load occurrence or to <b>running preemptively</b> if at the start of the day, the following day forecast is cloudy. </p>
	<h4>Starting up</h4>
	<p>The system is starting up, the delay is given by the BiomassParameters.startupDelayHours variable. If the PV power becomes sufficient to run the load, the state will change to <b>idle</b> again. If the counter finishes the system state becomes <b>running</b> or if it is a new day and forecast as cloudy, it will start <b>running preemptively</b> immediately</p>
	<h4>Running</h4>
	<p>The generator is on and produce power to the grid. Will turn off and go to <b>idle</b>if the PV power to the grid becomes sufficient to cover the load, so that the generator is not needed anymore. The system will start <b>running preemptively</b> if a cloudy day is forecast at the start of a day. If there is not enough output kW to bring the grid online, then the system will wait and try again later in the <b>waiting to retry state</b>. If the system runs out of sufficient, the state machine will wait for a biomass delivery in the <b>insufficient biomass/fuel</b> state.</p>
	<h4>Running Preemptively</h4>
	<p> Charging the batteries with the biomass system. The system is trying to compensate for a forecast cloudy day through staying on for an extended period of time. The system will keep working preemptively until the battery is either full, or if a sunny day is predicted, in which case it will return to the <b>idle</b> state. If either runs out of biomass or has insufficient kW output, it will be interrupted and go to the <b>insufficient biomass</b> or <b>waiting to retry</b> states respectively. The system will transition directly into this state without a startup delay, as this is scheduled operation, any startup delay is assumed included in the schedule. </p>
	<h4>Waiting To Retry</h4>
	<p>The generator does not have enough output kW to bring the grid back online, and will therefore be wasted if left on, the system waits for the length of BiomassParameters.retryDelayHours and then goes back to the state it was in before the generator was switched off. If there is a prediction for a cloudy day during the wait, the system will change it's next state to <b>running preemptively</b>, if it initially was in this state and there is a sunny forecast, then the state will go to <b>idle</b></p>
	<h4>Insufficient Biomass</h4>
	<p>The system is out of biomass and waits for a new delivery before it goes back to the <b>idle</b> state.</p>

<h3 id="economic-analysis"> [ EconomicAnalysisOutputs ] = economic_analysis( SimuationParameters, BatteryParameters, InverterParameters, SimulationInputData, EconomicParameters, SimulationOutputs) </h3>
<p> This module provide the economic calculations for the simulation results. The module output is the class EconomicAnalysisResults. The output matrices typically have one set of economic calculations for each PV and battery combination. Computation complexity O(n^2) (nPvSteps * nBattSteps)</p>
<p>The analysis does roughly the following: figures out the costs depending on the different system sizes, these depend on the simulation parameters (except inverter). Then the wear on the battery in sumPartialCyclesUsed yield how many times the batteries must be replaced, and the cost of this.</p>
<h3 id="economic-analysis-biomass"> [ EconomicAnalysisOutputs ] = economic_analysis_biomass( SimuationParameters, BatteryParameters, InverterParameters, SimulationInputData, B EconomicParameters, SimulationOutputs)</h3>
<p> The same as the previous economic analysis but includes the present cost of biomass maintenance and fuel. Also adds the investment cost of the biomass system to the output</p>
<h3 id="llp-constrained-optimums">  [ OptimalOutputs ] = llp_constrained_optimums( SimulationParameters, SimulationOutputs, EconomicAnalysisOutputs ) </h3>
<p> Finds the optimal values for each loss of load value in the llpSearcg span. For every specific value of loss of load probability, the algorithm tries to find simulations with the same LLP and will then choose the one simulation with the lowest net present cost.</p>
<h3 id="npc-constrained-optimums"> [ OptimalOutputs ] = npc_constrained_optimums( SimulationParameters, SimulationOutputs, EconomicAnalysisOutputs ) </h3>
<p> Works the same way as the llp_constrained_optimums module, just the other way around. Will search for a desired set of NPC values, and will amongst them choose the solutions that has the smallest LLP.</p>
<h3 id="lcoe-optimums"> [ OptimalOutputs ] = lcoe_optimums( SimulationParameters, SimulationOutputs, EconomicOutputs ) </h3>
<p> This function finds the global minimum of levelized cost of energy for a simulation. For every extra battery that the system has to use, the LCoE increase by a step, and as the scale of the system go closer to that of needing another battery, the LCoE decrease. This can only be exploited if all the model parameters are very finely tuned to represent the real case scenario. See the <a href="simulations-overview"> simulations_overview </a> plot for a graphic representation of these steps.</p>

<p>All parameters, inputs and outputs are contained in classes. The classes allow for batch passing of variables, and offer some help functions for generating dependent variables. The classes also allow for more comprehensive naming, consistency and understanding the origin or relation of the variable. <b>The classes should be made pointers so that they are not copied between modules.

<blockquote>
	<h3 id="plot-state-of-charge"> plot_state_of_charge( SimulationParameters, BatteryParameters, SimulationOutputs, iPv, jBatt ) </h3>
		<p>Plots the normalized state of charge (nominal to battery size). The green line is overproduction which appears whenever the PV input to battery is larger than the battery max charge speed (kW). This plot enable inspection of the kWs that the battery fall short of supplying or absorbing. It also clearly illustrates occurrences of lost load and overproduction in scale to the battery normal use.</p>
	<h3 id="plot-average-state-of-charge"> plot_average_state_of_charge( SimulationParameters, BatteryParameters, SimulationOutputs, iPv, jBatt ) </h3>
	<p>Will plot an average day of the same principles as above. The problem with this is that the continuity between the battery, loss of load, and overproduction lines are not preserved, and hence will remove some of the scaled insight that the user experience from the time dependent plot.</p>
	<h3 id="plot-power-balance"> plot_power_balance( SimParam, BattParam,InvParam, SimInputData, SimOutput, iPv, jBatt ) </h3>
	<p> The power balance of the system with respect to the different power kWs directly available to load. This is referred to as net powers. Will allow inspection of the source of power to the load at any given time. The red line is covered by the blue line whenever the load is served. The yellow line illustrate the power from PV to the system. The integral of the yellow power from PV line will always be equal to the integral of the blue supplied load line.</p>
	<h3 id="plot-average-power-balance"> plot_average_power_balance( SimParam, BattParam,InvParam, SimInputData, SimOutput, iPv, jBatt ) </h3>
	<p> Plots an average day of the principle mentioned above. Very useful for evaluating the average behavior and performance of the simulated system </p>
	<h3 id="simulations-overview">simulations_overview( SimulationOutputs, EconomicOutputs )</h3>
	<p> Will make four plots which will display the loss of load probabilities, levelized costs of energy, the number of batteries replaced during simulation time and the net present costs of the different simulation pairs.

<blockquote>
<h3 id="cycles-to-failure">[cycles] = cycles_to_failure( depthOfDischarge )</h3>
<p> The cycles_to_failure function needs to be updated. The function is a fitting how many cycles the battery can handle at a certain level of discharge, before breaking down. This function will be supplied by the battery manufacturer and can simply be placed in the matlab function shown below.</p>

<h3 id="get-daily-average">[averageDay] = get_daily_average( input )</h3>
<p> For an array with hour resolution, this function calculates the average value for each hour in a day (24 hours). </p>
<h3 id="get-hour-resolution">[hourArray] = get_hour_resolution( inArray, pointsHourly )</h3>
<p> For an array with a resolution given by pointsHourly, this will combine the points into a hourly resolution array. </p>
<h3 id="get-most-expensive-solution">[pvKw, battKwh] = get_most_expensive_solution( load, EcoParam, BattParam, InvParam, operationMatinenanceReplacementCost, investmentCost )</h3>
<p> A function to find some bounds for simulation. Assuming that the batteries are used with maximum wear and tear, it finds a system given that one know the budget for both investment and operation and maintenance. This solution is not optimal, but will reflect a minimum performance that one can expect for a given budget. The purpose of this is to find some lower bound for simulation. The found solution is given analytically by: ... </p>
<h3 id="get-path-to-database"> [ path ] = get_path_to_database_folder( dataSetFolder ) </h3>
<p> Cross platform (OS), will return the full path to the database folder and a given sub-folder. This function assumes that the database folder is one step up from the functions folder. If you only want to operate in the database folder, pass an empty string argument.</p>
<h3 id="get-weather-predictions"> [ weatherPredictions ] = get_weather_predictions( pvPowerAbsorbedKw, nomPeakPvPowerTreshold )</h3>
<p> Returns a cell-array of weather predictions for the given absorbed power data. This is a heuristic function for guessing what days will be forecast as cloudy and sunny, for the case of running a generator preemptively. </p>
<h3 id="get-worst-case-batt-use">[ nBattEmployed, yearsBattOperational ] = get_worst_case_batt_use( load, minSoc, plantLifetime ) </h3>
<p> Assumes that every cycle that the load profile simulates is at maximum depth of discharge (minimum state of charge). This will output the most wearing use that the batteries can be subjected to. NOTE that this function will have to be "trained" for each data set to count the correct number of cycles, if you are sure that the cycles will occur once every day, this function can be replaced by plantLifetime/yearsBatteryOperational = plantLifetime/(1/(365/cycles_to_failure(1-minStateOfCharge)))</p>
<h3 id="get-longest-period">[ longestPeriod, indexOfLongestPeriod ] = get_longest_period( dataSet )</h3>
<p> Takes a vector and returns the longest period of nonzero values within that vector. Meaning that a completely nonzero vector will return longestPeriod = the sum of the entire set, and the indexOfLongestPeriod = 1.</p> 
<h3 id="get-worst-case-periods">[ LowestIrradiation, LargestLoadProfile, LargestLossOfLoad ] = get_worst_case_periods( load, irradiation, lossOfLoad )</h3>
<p> Returns three structs containing index and value for both week and day with worst values of the three input vectors. This means that the day with lowest irradiation will be found at LowestIrradiation.Day.time, and the sum of irradiation during this day is in LowestIrradiation.Day.value. The same logic applies to the other outputs.</p>
